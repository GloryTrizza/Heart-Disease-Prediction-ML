# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains information on various attributes of patients such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators. The goal is to use this data to train machine learning models that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease in patients.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found in the data directory of this repository. It contains information on various attributes of patients and whether or not they have heart disease. The dataset is provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can also be downloaded from Kaggle.

## Running the Notebook
To run the project, navigate to the root directory of this project and open the Jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction_ML.ipynb. The notebook is organized into several sections, each of which explores a different aspect of the heart disease data. The main sections are:
- Data exploration: This section explores the dataset and identifies trends and patterns in the heart disease data.
- Data cleaning: This section cleans the data and prepares it for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and other issues.
- Machine learning: This section trains machine learning models using various algorithms and evaluates their performance on the heart disease data.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. By using various algorithms and evaluating their performance on the heart disease data, this project provides insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning models for this task. The results of this project can be used to develop better models for predicting heart disease in patients, which can lead to better diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
